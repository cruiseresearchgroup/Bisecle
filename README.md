Bisecle is a neurobiology-inspired continual learning framework specifically designed for multimodal video-language understanding tasks. It addresses the critical issues of **catastrophic forgetting**, **update conflict**, and **semantic overlap** across sequential video question answering tasks. The model leverages a multi-directional supervision module alongside a contrastive prompt learning mechanism, significantly enhancing model stability and generalization capabilities.


## 🧠 Core Contributions
1. **Multi-Directional Supervision Module**

Inspired by the mechanism of hippocampus to achieve rapid binding over multiple modalities, linking multimodal information dynamically into cohesive memory.

2. **Contrastive Prompt Learning**

Addresses inter-task prompt conflicts using contrastive learning, promoting semantic separation and preventing forgetting.

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/bisecle.git
    cd bisecle
    ```

2. **Setup environment (recommended):**

    ```
    conda create -n bisecle python=3.10 -y
    conda activate bisecle
    ```

## 🔧 Running the experiments


The baseline experiment trains the model in the conventional way.

* To fine-tune the model with Bisecle on NExT-QA:
```
python train_nextQA.py --batch_size 32 --adapter_layer 32 --tqcp_weight 0.1 --weight_decay 0.14
```
* To fine-tune the model with Bisecle on DramaQA:
```
python train_dramaQA.py --batch_size 4 --adapter_layer 32 --tqcp_weight 1 --weight_decay 0.1
```
* To fine-tune the model with Bisecle on STAR:
```
python train_starQA.py --batch_size 16 --adapter_layer 32 --tqcp_weight 0.1 --weight_decay 0.1
```
